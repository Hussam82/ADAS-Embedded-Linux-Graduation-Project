## GUI

The GUI folder contains the user interface components for the ADAS application. It includes graphical elements and user interaction features that enable users to interact with the ADAS system effectively. The GUI is designed to provide a seamless experience for monitoring and controlling various ADAS functionalities.

For detailed information on building and using the GUI, please refer to the **README** file located within the GUI folder.

## Yocto Image

The Yocto Image folder contains the necessary configurations and recipes to build the Embedded Linux distribution customized for the ADAS application. Yocto Project is used to generate a minimal and efficient Linux image that includes all the required dependencies and components for running the ADAS system.

For detailed instructions on building the Yocto image and customizing it for your target platform, please refer to the **README** file located within the Yocto Image folder.

## Web Server

The Web Server folder contains the implementation of a web server for the ADAS application. The web server allows users to access and interact with the ADAS system using web-based interfaces. This enables remote monitoring and control of the ADAS functionalities through web browsers or mobile devices.

For information on setting up and using the web server, please refer to the **README** file located within the Web Server folder.

Please make sure to follow the instructions in each folder's **README** file to ensure a successful setup and usage of the ADAS Embedded Linux application.

For any questions or issues related to the project, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or refer to the project's issue tracker.

Thank you for your interest in the ADAS Embedded Linux project!
