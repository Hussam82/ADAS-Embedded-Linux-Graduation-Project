# ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System)

ADAS is a software system designed to assist drivers in driving a vehicle safely and efficiently. This system uses various sensors, cameras, and algorithms to monitor the road and the surroundings of the vehicle, providing real-time feedback to the driver.

## Features

ADAS includes the following features:

- Lane Detection: To keep the driver's attention.
- Close vehicles detection: To be ready for future work.
- Traffic Sign Recognition: Identifies and displays speed limit signs and other traffic signals.
- Pedestrian Detection: Detects pedestrians in the path of the vehicle and alerts the driver.

## Installation

ADAS is a software system that is typically installed in the vehicle's computer system. The installation process may vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle. It is recommended that the installation is done by a certified professional to ensure proper installation and functionality.

## Usage

ADAS is designed to assist drivers in driving safely and efficiently. The system provides real-time feedback to the driver, helping them avoid accidents and stay within the speed limit. To use ADAS, the driver must activate the system and follow the instructions provided.

## Limitations

ADAS is designed to assist drivers, but it is not a substitute for safe driving practices. The system may not detect all hazards on the road, and the driver must remain alert at all times. It is also important to note that the system may not function properly in extreme weather conditions or poor visibility.
